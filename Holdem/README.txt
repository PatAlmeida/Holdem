This program currently simulates the Poker game No-Limit Holdem.
It is an unfinished extension of an assignment I did while in a Game Programming course in college.
It simulates one hand using a very simple AI. The CPU players choose what action to do only based on randomly choosing one of their possible actions.
The GUI is implemented with Java's swing library. I am also proficient with JavaFX.
Note that I coded most of this in 2016 and since then I have changed some of my programming habits and have become a better developer. 

I have included screenshots of the program running in the demos directory.
